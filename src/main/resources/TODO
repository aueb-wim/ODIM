1) Add MIPMAP Engine as dependency.
2) Build Interface with FoRule. transform(FORULE) -> Incremental FORULE


    What is the exact interface I need?


    public _ transform(_)

    Each FORule has a targetView which is associated to an AlgebraTree

    Understand the following:

    Run a MipMap Example and display sourceView and TargetView

    createTGD() at TGDListTopComponent see a TGD. OR EVEN BETTER

    Use mipmapreduced to build Mapping Scenarios. Actually build it with csvs and xml... Then run full cycle. generatecandidatestttatget.java gives you candidate tgds

3) Build in
